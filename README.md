## Industry 

### Vendor Reports

Vendors tend to focus their reports on the main topics of their target customer group. Probably not only because this is the main source of their data.

- A global, multi-platform anti malware software vendor 

*Recent Report*

- Main threat (p. 6, 8-12): Adware (https://de.malwarebytes.com/adware/)
- Mac threat (p. 24):
  - ... the average number of threats detected on a Mac is not only on the rise, 
    but has surpassed Windowsâ€”by a great deal.
  - This is likely because, with increasing market share in 2019,
    Macs became more attractive targets to cybercriminals
